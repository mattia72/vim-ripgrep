##  Installation

It is recommended to use a plugin manager for Vim plugins.
If you prefer [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug "vim-plug") as
well, put this lines into your plugin list:
```
Plug 'skywind3000/asyncrun.vim'  " If you prefer async behaviour
Plug 'mattia72/vim-ripgrep' 
```
